          Creamy pesto chicken is a fast, easy, and impressive main dish for
          dinner, whether you just want to treat yourself or impress guests!
        </p>
        Recipe
        <p>
          Fillet the chicken breasts into two thinner pieces (or pound the
          chicken to an even thickness then cut each breast in half to create
          four portions). Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper on
          both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil and
          swirl to coat the surface. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook on
          each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 7-10 minutes
          total). Remove the chicken to a clean plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the remaining olive oil to the
          skillet along with the minced garlic and halved grape tomatoes. Saut√©
          for about five minutes, or until the tomatoes start to soften and lose
          their shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the heavy cream and pesto to the skillet with the tomatoes and
          stir to combine. Allow the sauce to come up to a simmer. Taste the
          sauce and adjust the salt or pepper to your liking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the chicken back to the skillet with the tomatoes and sauce,
          turning to coat the chicken. Allow the chicken to simmer in the sauce
          for just a few minutes more to heat through. Serve hot.
